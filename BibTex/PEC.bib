abstract = {Polymer – surface interactions strongly influence many important industrial and rheological flows. In particular, polymer melts and solutions slip against the sur- face; this has long been associated with sharkskin and spurt in extrusion, and recent experimental observations suggest that slip also plays a role in the formation of enhanced concentration fluctuations in entangled polymer solutions. Analyses of melt flow in model geometries, incorporating simple slip models which include the effects of chain orientation and stretching, and employing common linear and nonlinear viscoelastic models for the polymer stress, demonstrate that slip can lead to short-wave hydrodynamic instabilities. The results predict values of the critical recoverable shear, the critical shear rate, and the frequency of distortion that are consistent with experimental observations for sharkskin during extrusion of linear polyethylenes. Further analysis, employing slip models generalized to include the effects of normal load (i.e. pressure) at the surface, confirms and unifies previ- ous theoretical work: shear stress dependent slip models cannot predict instabilities consistent with sharkskin; and pressure dependent slip leads to instability due to ill- posedness at the boundary. Computational studies performed for polymer solutions highlight the importance of boundaries on the flow behavior. Computations were carried out using a two-fluid model in which stress and concentration are coupled. This coupling gives rise to enhanced fluctuations in the bulk, and the additional coupling with slip leads to hydrodynamic instability. The length scales for slip (the extrapolation length) and instability (the reciprocal of the wavenumber for the disturbance) are the same and are consistent with experiment. Incorporation of thermal fluctuations shows that the fluctuations near the surface are dramatically enhanced relative to those in the bulk. The wavevector for enhanced fluctuations rotates as the shear rate increases, in agreement with bulk experiments and predic- tions, so that the mechanism for near-surface enhancement is essentially the same as in the bulk. As opposed to the flow instability, these enhanced fluctuations are insensitive to the presence of slip. Overall, these analyses highlight the importance of bounding surfaces on the macroscopic flow behavior and of coupling between various flow features, such as stress, concentration, and slip.},

abstract = {Small gap, torsional, parallel plate experiments allow the measurement of shear stress and slip velocity at shear rates comparable to those measured in slit and capillary rheometers. Using this technique we compare data from parallel plate measurements, where effects of pressure and temperature are negligible, to those from pressure driven flows where they are not. The shear stress for all techniques agrees within experimental error at low shear rates. At higher shear rates the slit and capillary measurements diverge from the parallel plate measurements highlighting the effect of pressure and temperature on viscosity. Also, breakdown of the Cox-Merz rule at slightly higher shear rates is apparent when comparing dynamic and steady shear data from the parallel plate experiments. Since the complex viscosity diverges in the same manner as the viscosity derived from pressure driven flow it seems as if agreement of the complex viscosity with the viscosity derived from pressure driven flow is fortuitous. With the capillary geometry, there is no sign of slip effects at low stress levels probably due to experimental limitations while the torsional rheometer shows slip at all shear stresses. There is no critical stress for the onset of slip but there is a critical stress where slip increases dramatically. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Ramamurthy1986,
abstract = {The question of slip and the influence of materials of construction on the observed extrudate irregularities are examined for high viscosity molten polyethylenes. Capillary rheometer studies were conducted for several linear (LLDPE and HDPE) and branched (HP‐LDPE) polyethylenes, Viton A, and Barex‐210. Extensive blown film fabrication studies were conducted for narrow MWD UNIPOL process LLDPE resins. The results indicate that the assumption of “no‐slip at the rigid boundary” is generally not valid for polyethylenes above a critical shear stress of approximately 0.1–0.14 MPa, when either surface or gross irregularities are present in the extrudate. Loss of extrudate gloss at the critical shear stress defines the onset of melt fracture. Within the range of variables examined, the critical stress is relatively insensitive to molecular characteristics (molecular weight, MWD, and chain branching), melt temperature, and the detailed design of the capillary. Contrary to capillary rheometer observations, blown film fabrication results for LLDPE indicate that materials of construction for the die land region have a significant influence on melt fracture, and suggest breakdown of adhesion at the polymer∕metal interface as a primary cause of slip and melt fracture. The results demonstrate that methods to improve adhesion, by proper choice of materials of construction for the die land region and∕or use of adhesion promoters in the resin, virtually eliminate the rate‐limiting effects of melt fracture in commercial blown film fabrication. The results highlight a deficiency of standard capillary rheometer methods to delineate the influence of materials of construction and∕or adhesion promoters on observed melt fracture characteristics with molten polyethylenes.},

abstract = {Synopsis A high-density polyethylene ͑HDPE͒, a poly͑dimethylsiloxane͒ ͑PDMS͒, and an oxetane based alternating block thermoplastic elastomer ͑TPE͒ were subjected to steady torsional and capillary flows. HDPE and PDMS exhibited wall slip in steady torsional flow. The shear stress ranges at which wall slip became apparent during steady torsional flow for HDPE and PDMS coincided with the wall shear stress ranges in capillary flow at which distortions of the extrudates emerging from capillary die were first noted. In contrast, TPE did not exhibit wall slip in steady torsional flow ͑for shear rates up to 200 s Ϫ1 and strains up to 25͒. None of the three polymers exhibited any overshoots of shear stress or first normal stress difference under steady flow conditions, indicating that the often-reported stress overshoots could be artifacts of wall slip. Furthermore, the extrudates of the TPE were relatively smooth and exhibited only minor and nonperiodic surface blemishes. The absence of extrudate distortions under the presumed no-slip condition for TPE emphasizes the intimate link between wall slip and the development of extrudate distortions and strengthens the premise that extrusion flow instabilities can be eliminated under conditions of stable wall slip or stick.},

abstract = {Several significant problems arise when film is fabricated on a large scale. One of these is the appearance of irregularities on the extrudate surfaces when the polymer melt is extruded at high rates. These irregularities vary in intensity and form and are generally known as sharkskin melt fracture. This phenomenon, which occurs when the wall shear stress exceeds a critical value, is a limiting factor for production rates in many industrial extrusion operations such as film blowing of polyethylene. We used a sliding plate rheometer incorporating a shear stress transducer to study slip in both steady and unsteady flows. By combining a dynamic slip model with a nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive model, we determined the slip model parameters for LLDPE film resin with and without a fluoropolymer sharkskin suppressant. The models give good prediction of our slip data in steady shear but show insufficient gap dependence in exponential shear. Our own film blowing studies demonstrated the efficiency of the sharkskin suppressant; it has more than doubled the throughput in our laboratory setup. The fluoropolymer additive was found to profoundly affect both the steady and dynamic slip parameters. Hence, the sharkskin suppressant alters how the LLDPE remembers its past slipping motions.},

abstract = {A chemical-type theory for wall slip in polymer melts is developed by modeling the exchange of bridging sites between two opposing polymeric and solid surfaces. Kinetic equations, describing surface coverage by bridging monomers, are formulated and analyzed to evaluate the stability of adhesive contact and slip characteristics of the viscoelastic melt. Order of magnitude estimates of the kinetic coefficients suggest that the polymer–solid interface is always at equilibrium, even under slip. The model displays the following features. The polymer slips at all stresses; the slip velocity, v s , obeys time-free volume superposition and depends on both shear and normal stresses. At small stresses, v s is linear in shear stress and proportional to a function of the work of adhesion; the slip parameter b (the slip extrapolation length scale) takes on the same form as that proposed by de Gennes, but displays an additional dependence on adhesive energy. At constant v s the shear stress is proportional to the adhesivefree energy. A catastrophic loss of adhesion occurs at a critical stress that depends on the difference between the work of adhesion (polymer–solid) and the work of cohesion (polymer–polymer). Predictions compare favorably with literature data for slip of linear low-density polyethylene on metal.},

abstract = {There is considerable experimental evidence that the classical no-slip boundary condition of fluid mechanics is not always a valid assumption for the flow of high molecular weight molten polymers. In fact, molten polymers slip macroscopically at solid surfaces when the wall shear stress exceeds a critical value. Moreover, for linear polymers there exists a second critical wall shear stress value at which a transition from a weak to a strong slip occurs. These two modes of slip (weak and strong) are due to flow-induced chain detachment/desorption at the polymer/wall interface and to chain disentanglement of the polymer chains in the bulk from a monolayer of polymer chains adsorbed at the interface. In this review, the two physical mechanisms of slip are discussed and validated on the basis of published experimental data. The slip velocity of molten polymers is a complex function and has been reported to depend on wall shear and normal stresses, temperature, and molecular characteristics of polymers (molecular weight and its distribution). Proposed slip models, static and dynamic, are also reviewed and their significance on the rheology and flow simulations of molten polymers is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Apparent violations of the no-slip boundary condition are studied using a series of narrow molecular-weight distribution polybutadiene melts (67300 ≤ M̄n ≤ 650000), subjected to plane-Couette shearing over clean silica glass surfaces. Simultaneous measurements of slip velocity and shear stress reveal several new molecular characteristics of slip in entangled polymers. log-log plots of slip velocity versus shear stress display three distinct power-law regimes: (i) A weak slip regime at low shear stresses that is characterized by extrapolation/slip lengths b of the order of a few micrometers; (ii) A stick-slip regime at intermediate shear stresses marked by periodic oscillations in slip velocity and shear stress; (iii) A strong slip regime beyond a defined critical shear stress $\sigma$*. Slip violations in this last regime are characterized by large slip velocities and massive extrapolation lengths (b∞ ∼, 100-1500 $\mu$m). For all polymers studied the critical stress $\sigma$* for the weak-to-strong slip transition is found to be proportional to the plateau modulus Ge of the bulk polymer, $\sigma$* ≈ (0.2 ± 0.02) Ge. This finding is consistent with a shear-induced polymer disentanglement explanation for apparent slip violations in entangled polymers. Our experimental observations are also found to be in good agreement with a recently proposed scaling theory for friction and slip in entangled polymers, which assumes noninteracting surface chains. We rationalize this last result in terms of a polymer adsorption model in which a single macromolecule spontaneously attaches to numerous surface sites, yet offers a sufficiently long tail to resist relative motion of a chemically identical bulk polymer that attempts to slide over it.},

abstract = {The classical no-slip boundary condition of fluid mechanics is not always a valid assumption for the flow of complex fluids including polymer melts. Since the slip velocity of polymer melts complicates analysis of rheological data and it is needed for simulation of polymer processes and process optimization, a comprehensive predictive slip velocity model should be developed. In this thesis, the slip behavior of monodisperse and polydisperse linear polymers including high-density polyethylenes (HDPEs), polybutadienes (PBDs), and polystyrenes (PSs) is studied to fully understand the effect of molecular weight (MW) and molecular weight distribution (MWD). Concepts from double reptation mixing rule are used to develop an expression for slip velocity of polydisperse polymers based on their MW and MWD. Very good agreement between experimental data and predictions of proposed model is observed, validating the applicability of the model. Surface enrichment of short chains next to solid boundaries due to entropic effects complicates slip analysis specially in the case of bimodal polymers. To address surface segregation, the slip behavior of several HDPEs with broad range of molecular weight including bimodals is studied. Moreover, the developed slip model coupled with a model of surface molecular weight fractionation is used to predict the slip velocity of the studied polymers. It is observed that surface fractionation has a minor effect on slip of narrow to moderate MWD polymers (particularly unimodal), but its role is significant for broad bimodal polymers. Moreover, the dynamic slip behavior of a polymer melt was investigated by performing dynamic shear experiments using the stress/strain controlled rotational rheometer equipped with parallel partitioned plate geometry. The multimode integral Kaye-Bernstein-Kearsley-Zapas (KBKZ) constitutive model is applied and it is found that a dynamic slip model with a slip relaxation time is needed to adequately predict the experimental data at large shear deformations. Finally, the effects of surface topology and energy on slip velocity of high-density HDPEs was studied using treated and untreated smooth and patterned slit dies. It was found that the slip velocity is decreased by roughness and is increased by silanization. These effects have been incorporated into the slip velocity model.},

abstract = {This study concerns with the explanation of the wide range of adhesion strengths observed depending on the nature of substrate surface topography by linking macroscopic adhesion strength to microscopic energy-expenditure mechanisms during fracture. The dominant factors to which the adhesion strength of polymermetal interfaces is attributed are investigated theoretically and experimentally. In an attempt to elucidate the effect of mechanical interlock on adhesion strength, micro-patterns were fabricated on metal surfaces as a designed surface topography. It was found that the molecular dissipation of the polymer in the vicinity of the interface is the major cause of the practical energy of separation. Furthermore, it is shown that loading mode controls the mechanical interlock effect, which is attributed to the fact that the stress distribution at the interface controls the deformation and failure characteristics of the polymer resin near the interface. Therefore, mechanical interlock promoted by adsorption provokes energy dissipation processes during fracture, which practically constitute the adhesion strength of a polymermetal interface. The contribution of mechanical interlock to adhesion strength is systematically assessed by varying micro-pattern dimensions. The influence of the work of adhesion, cohesion and other dissipation energy on adhesion strength is examined by measuring each contribution to the total work of fracture. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS), with closely matched viscosity, were coextruded into 8, 32, and 64 alternating layers. The apparent steady shear viscosity of these multilayer samples was measured with an in-line slit rheometer and with a parallel-plate rheometer. In both cases the apparent viscosity decreased with the number of layers providing strong evidence for interfacial slip. The velocity difference across the interface (interfacial slip velocity) versus shear stress, VI( ) was calculated from the apparent viscosity measurements. VI() showed sigmoidal behavior: a region of very low slip ( {\textless} 10-3 um) at low shear stress, a strongly increasing region at t {\textgreater} 10 3 Pa followed by a linear region VI  /  . These data could be fit with a modified Ellis model. The same function fit the different number of layers and both slit and parallel-plate data indicating VI(  ) is a material property of the PP/PS pair. Slip was also observed in PS/PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) and PP/aPA (amorphous nylon) pairs. Addition of a premade P(S-b-EE) diblock copolymer to the PP/PS pair was able to suppress the interfacial slip but only after enough time for sufficient block copolymers to diffuse to the interfaces. The in situ formed graft copolymer of maleated PP with aPA at the interface of the PP/aPA pair directly suppressed the slip. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the theory of Furukawa (1989) and de Gennes (1992), which predicts fewer chain entanglements near the interface between two immiscible polymers, and thus a narrow region ( {\~{}} interfacial width) with lower viscosity. This lower viscosity is the cause of apparent interfacial slip. Goveas and Fredrickson (1998) extended these ideas to calculate the slip in a symmetric bilayer where both bulk and interface are Newtonian. Their results are in qualitative agreement with our observation but predict a stronger slip. Our results also indicate that the anomalously low viscosity reported by a number of researchers for immiscible polymer blends is due to interfacial slip. Blends of PP and PS show similar negative viscosity deviations to those reported but only at t {\textgreater} 2000 Pa. No negative deviations were found for linear viscoelastic (low-stress) measurements.},

abstract = {The behavior of glass-fiber reinforced phenolic resin in the presence of the wall surface during injection molding under various processing parameters has been studied with a rather simple but effective and useful method, namely, the spotwise painting of the mold wall surface. The experimental results show clearly a strong slip of the phenolic melt on the cavity surface. The occurrence of slip begins immediately when the phenolic melt contacts the wall surface. This technique was applied to study the slip of thermoplastic melts inside a rectangular mold. However, completely opposite results found between the flow behavior of thermosets and thermoplastics on the cavity surface raise the questions concerning the applicability of thermoplastics injection molding concepts and rheological property testing methods, respectively, simulation packages for thermosets.},

@misc{Wang1997,
abstract = {This article summarizes our recent experimental studies of an important class of polymer melt rheological phenomena including flow instabilities, stick-slip transitions, interfacial melt/wall slip, gross extrudate distortion and sharkskin like surface roughening of extradates. Our experimental results indicate that most aspects of the perplexing flow behavior of strongly entangled melts in polymer extrusion can be depicted in terms of melt/wall interfacial interactions at a molecular level. For high surface energy walls, a transition from no-slip to slip hydrodynamic boundary condition (HBC) occurs through molecular disentanglement (coil-to-stretch) of adsorbed chains from unbound chains. For weakly adsorbing walls, interfacial slip takes place through a second molecular mechanism involving a stress-induced polymer desorption process. Since the coil-stretch transition of adsorbed chains is controlled by interfacial shear stress, the HBC can be unstable throughout the die wall under the condition of a constant flow rate, where the wall stress may fluctuate in time. Unstable HBC due to the interfacial molecular instabilities is shown to be the origin of a variety of global and local flow instabilities including the oscillating flow and the sharkskin like distortion of extrudate surface. With a set of new experiments to directly probe the interfacial molecular processes, we will be able to support the unified understanding of intriguing capillary melt flow characteristics summarized in this article.},

@article{Lee1994,
abstract = {The purpose of this review is to demonstrate that there are well established molecular bonding and strong interactions between monomers or polymers and metals. We discuss both theoretical and experimental work related to adsorption and adhesion at polymer-metal interphases. Firstly, we briefly describe the fractal nature of polymer-metal interphases, and the effect of chemisorption on fractal dimension. Secondly, we mention several theoretical studies related to the models and the conformation of polymer segments to metal surfaces. Recent theoretical work by others with molecular modeling has provided some insight about the interfaces; however, this type of work is still at an early stage. Thirdly, we cite the experimental work by others with XPS, SERS (surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy), Mossbauer emission spectroscopy, etc., on chemisorption, molecular bonding, redox interaction, restructuring of polar groups, and contact oxidation of polymers on metal surfaces. Among them, SERS and XPS are capable of describing chemical composition and conformation right at the interfaces. These results appear very valuable in understanding the formation of the architectural framework of a functional interphase beyond the superficial blending. In general, some preliminary data indicate that adhesion of polymers is greatly improved by various forms of strong interactions, e.g., chemisorption and molecular bonding at polymer-metal interphases. However, strong chemical reactions at the interphases may not be always beneficial to adhesion and physical properties. {\textcopyright} 1994, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

@article{Aho2011,
abstract = {Rheological properties of polymer melts were studied using a slit die attached to an injection molding machine. The die has three exchangeable inserts to set the slit height to 0.75, 1.0, or 1.5 mm. The modular design eases the die cleaning, and measurements with variable slit heights enable the detection of possible wall slip. Two grades of polypropylene and two grades of polystyrene were studied using the slit die and the results were compared to those obtained using a capillary rheometer and a rotational rheometer in steady and dynamic modes. The examination of the selected polymers with different slits gave essentially the same results at each slit height, verifying the absence of wall slip. The agreement with the conventional off-line rheometer results was very good for all polymers studied. This suggests that a simple slit die construction can be used as an inexpensive rheometer to measure rheological properties of polymer melts for processing purposes. The thermo-mechanical history of the investigated melt in the in-line slit die experiments resembles that in actual melt processing and, therefore, determination of rheological properties under true processing conditions is possible. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A steady-state dependence of slip velocity on shear stress at polymer/solid surfaces is derived from a molecular model that includes effects of drag on polymer chains, disentanglement, and detachment and reattachment of chains from the solid surface. The dependence includes two turning points and thus a region where slip velocity is a multivalued function of shear stress. This behavior is consistent with experimental observations of abrupt and hysteretic transitions between regimes of small and large slip. Parameters involved in the model are estimated and a reasonable comparison with experiment is obtained. (C) 1998 The Society of Rheology. [S0148-6055(98)01106-7]. },

@article{Grujicic2008,
abstract = {The work published in the open literature dealing with various polymer metal hybrid (PMH) approaches used to promote direct (adhesive-free) adhesion between metal and injection-molded thermoplastics is reviewed and critiqued. Different approaches are categorized as follows: (a) micro-scale polymer-to-metal mechanical interlocking; (b) in-coil or stamped-part pre-coating for enhanced adhesion; and (c) chemical modifications of the injection-molded thermoplastics for enhanced polymer-to-metal adhesion. For each of these approaches their suitability for use in load-bearing body-in-white (BIW) components is discussed. In particular, the compatibility of these approaches with the BIW manufacturing process chain (i.e. pre-coated metal component stamping, BIW construction via different joining technologies, BIW pre-treated and painting operations) is presented. It has been found that while considerable amount of research has been done in the PMH direct-adhesion area, many aspects of these technologies which are critical from the standpoint of their use in the BIW structural applications have not been addressed (or addressed properly). Among the PMH technologies identified, the one based on micro-scale mechanical inter locking between the injection-molded thermoplastic polymer and stamped-metal structural rib component appears to be most promising. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The interfacial characteristics of a variety of polymer/wall interfaces were measured by using the sessile drop method in order to calculate the work of adhesion. Polymers included linear low-density as well high-density polyethylenes, while wall substrates included clean stainless steel and modified stainless steel by applying two different fluoropolymers in order to alter its surface energy. A linear correlation is found between the critical shear stress for the onset of slip and the work of adhesion of the corresponding polymer/wall interface, in agreement with earlier publications of Hill et al. (1991) and Hatzikiriakos et al. (1993). In the present work, the experimental results are interpreted in terms of parameters defined by these two theories. It is suggested that small deviations from the no-slip boundary condition in the case of polymer melt flow are due to a stress-induced chain detachment/desorption of polymer chains from the wall. {\textcopyright} 1998 The Society of Rheology.},
