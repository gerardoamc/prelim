abstract = {The relatively low cost of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) printers and wide variety of materials -spanning multiple functionalities and prices- make this process interesting for production of functional parts. However, FFF produced objects underperform in terms of mechanical properties when compared to injection molding. Therefore, a study of tensile properties of FFF produced parts was conducted according to the ASTM D-638 standard, using a commercial and an in-house produced ABS filament. Initial tests using commercial ABS revealed poor reproducibility of results, which were analyzed in detail in this study. This led to designing a formal bed levelling procedure for the printer, evaluating effects of printer configuration and material quality as well as exploring modifications to the ASTM test procedure. As a result, test specimens with properties close to injection molding parts were produced. Therefore, the different impact factors will be discussed and the new procedures will be presented.},

abstract = {A new criterion of strength is proposed for anisotropic materials of the glass-reinforced plastic type. This criterion takes into account not only the different ultimate strengths in tension and compression in each direction but also the dependence of the ultimate shear strengths on the sign (direction) of the shear stresses. The criterion is given in tensor invariant form, so that it can be rewritten for any direction of the glass fibers. The criteria proposed by other authors, in particular, R. Hill's condition of plasticity [1], follow from the new generalized criterion as special cases. The results of experiments conducted both by the authors of the present article and by other investigators provide good confirmation of the proposed criterion.},

Fused deposition modeling (FDM) and 3D printer are commercial RP processes while nano composite deposition system (NCDS) is an RP testbed system that uses nano composites materials as the part material. To predict the mechanical behavior of parts made by RP, measurement of the material properties of the RP material is important. Each process was characterizes by process parameters such as raster orientation, air gap, bead width, color, and model temperature for FDM. 3D printer and NCDS had different process parameters.

abstract = {To aid in the transition of 3D printed parts from prototypes to functional products it is necessary to investigate the mechanical anisotropy induced by the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process. Since the mechanical properties of an FFF part are most greatly affected by the bead orientation and printed density, or solidity ratio, techniques to precisely control these variables are required. An open source Python program, SciSlice, was developed to create the desired tool paths/layer orientations and convert them into machine commands (e.g. G-Code). SciSlice was then used to develop tool paths which either directly printed tensile specimens or printed sheets from which specimens could be water-jet cut. The effects of proper bed leveling and feed wheel adjustment are noted and a careful analysis of both bead orientation and solidity ratio are presented. Printing artifacts related to turns made at the part edges are discussed having been found to have strong effects on the measure strength in the weakest orientation. Finally, it is shown that with proper bead orientation, low layer heights, and a maximum solidity ratio, tensile strengths within 3{\%} of injection molded parts are achievable.},

@article{Baumers2016,
abstract = {As part of the cosmos of digital fabrication technology, Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems are able to manufacture three-dimensional components and products directly from raw material and 3D design data. The layer-by-layer operating process of these systems does not require the use of tools, moulds or dies. Technology observers speculate that AM will have a profound economic impact on the manufacturing sector and indeed on wider society. By constructing a model of production cost for two different AM systems used commercially for the manufacture of end-use metal parts, Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), this paper performs an inter-process comparison of cost performance. High specific costs, measured at {\pounds}2.39 and {\pounds}6.18 per cm3of material deposited respectively, are identified as a central impediment to more widespread technology adoption of such additive systems. The research demonstrates differing levels of system productivity, suggesting that the observed deposition rates are not sufficient for the adoption of EBM and DMLS in high volume manufacturing applications. Despite the absence of amortisable tooling costs, the analysis also reveals that economies of scale are achievable in AM. The results reached are further discussed in the light of the varying strategic requirements posed by the market-pull and technology-push modes of innovation which are both found in the AM industry.},

@article{Rankouhi2016,
abstract = {In contrast to conventional subtractive manufacturing methods which involve removing material to reach the desired shape, additive manufacturing is the technology of making objects directly from a computer-aided design model by adding a layer of material at a time. In this study, a comprehensive effort was undertaken to represent the strength of a 3D printed object as a function of layer thickness by investigating the correlation between the mechanical properties of parts manufactured out of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) using fused deposition modeling and layer thickness and orientation. Furthermore, a case study on a typical support frame is done to generalize the findings of the extensive experimental work done on tensile samples. Finally, fractography was performed on tensile samples via a scanning digital microscope to determine the effects of layer thickness on failure modes. Statistical analyses proved that layer thickness and raster orientation have significant effect on the mechanical properties. Tensile test results showed that samples printed with 0.2 mm layer thickness exhibit higher elastic modulus and ultimate strength compared with 0.4 mm layer thickness. These results have direct influence on decision making and future use of 3D printing and functional load bearing parts.},

Stratasys Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a typical RP process that can fabricate prototypes out of ABS plastic. To predict the mechanical behavior of FDM parts, it is critical to understand the material properties of the raw FDM process material, and the effect that FDM build parameters have on anisotropic material properties. This paper characterizes the properties of ABS parts fabricated by the FDM 1650. Using a Design of Experiment (DOE) approach, the process parameters of FDM, such as raster orientation, air gap, bead width, color, and model temperature were examined. Tensile strengths and compressive strengths of directionally fabricated specimens were measured and compared with injection molded FDM ABS P400 material. For the FDM parts made with a 0.003 inch overlap between roads, the typical tensile strength ranged between 65 and 72 percent of the strength of injection molded ABS P400. The compressive strength ranged from 80 to 90 percent of the injection molded FDM ABS. Several build rules for designing FDM parts were formulated based on experimental results.},

Currently, there exist a large number of lamina failure criteria and laminate failure analysis methods. In this project, a comprehensive and objective study of lamina and laminate failure criteria was performed. Comparisons among the commonly used failure criteria were made for failure in unidirectional composites under various loading cases. From these comparisons, the characteristics of these criteria were identified and discussed. Further, with the aid of some limited experimental lamina and laminate strength data available in the literature and new data generated by the authors, an attempt was made to select the failure criteria and laminate analysis methods that are mechanistically sound and are capable of accurately predicting lamina and laminate strengths for states of combined stresses. It was found that those lamina failure criteria which separate fiber and matrix failure modes most accurately predict lamina and laminate strength. 17.},

While currently used primarily to manufacture prototypes and mockups, a number of promising applications exist in the production of replacement parts, dental crowns, and artificial limbs, as well as in bridge manufacturing. 3-D printing has been compared to such disruptive technologies as digital books and music downloads that enable consumers to order their selections online, allow firms to profitably serve small market segments, and enable companies to operate with little or no unsold finished goods inventory.
