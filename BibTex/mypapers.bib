abstract = {The relatively low cost of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) printers and wide variety of materials -spanning multiple functionalities and prices- make this process interesting for production of functional parts. However, FFF produced objects underperform in terms of mechanical properties when compared to injection molding. Therefore, a study of tensile properties of FFF produced parts was conducted according to the ASTM D-638 standard, using a commercial and an in-house produced ABS filament. Initial tests using commercial ABS revealed poor reproducibility of results, which were analyzed in detail in this study. This led to designing a formal bed levelling procedure for the printer, evaluating effects of printer configuration and material quality as well as exploring modifications to the ASTM test procedure. As a result, test specimens with properties close to injection molding parts were produced. Therefore, the different impact factors will be discussed and the new procedures will be presented.},

abstract = {One of the most common Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies is Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), more commonly known by the trademarked name "Fused Deposition Modeling™" (FDM™). As FFF continues to gain popularity as a method of manufacturing, an understanding of all factors involved in the FFF process becomes essential. This study is an attempt to understand four primary printing parameters and the effects they have on part quality, solidity, and strength. These printing parameters are extrusion rate, nozzle travel speed, layer height, and path width. A recommendation for the determination of optimal extrusion temperature and feed rate was found. A theoretical relationship between the four print parameterswas developed. The resulting solidity was found to vary throughout a printed part, which has effects on the predictability of part strength. Micro computed tomography was proven valuable in this analysis as well as being an effective tool for investigating the bead structure.},

abstract = {Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is arguably the most widely available additive manufacturing technology at the moment. Offering the possibility of producing complex geometries in a compressed product development cycle and in a plethora of materials, it has gradually started to become attractive to multiple industrial segments, slowly being implemented in diverse applications. However, the high anisotropy of parts developed through this technique renders failure prediction difficult. The proper performance of the part, or even the safety of the final user, cannot be guaranteed under demanding mechanical requirements. This problem can be tackled through the development of a failure envelope that allows engineers to predict failure by using the knowledge of the stress state of the part. Previous research by the authors developed a failure envelope for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) based, Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) parts by use of a criterion that incorporates stress interactions. This work validates the first quadrant of the envelope by performing uniaxial tensile tests with coupons produced with a variety of raster angles, creating a combined loading stress state in the localized coordinate system. Results show the safe zone encompassed by the failure envelope proved adequate.},
